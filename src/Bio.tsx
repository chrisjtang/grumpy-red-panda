        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <div className='bio'>
          <p>
              My name is Chris and I'm a software engineer working on Zeta Global's <a href='https://disqus.com/' target='_blank'>Disqus</a> team. Disqus is the worldâ€™s largest engagement platform, and we serve an international network of 20 million commenters that leave 50 million comments and generate over 2.5 billion ad impressions per month.
          </p>
          <p>
              Aside from Disqus, I have also worked at <a href='https://viahero.com/' target='_blank'>ViaHero</a> - a travel service that has connected 20k+ travelers with locals for 11k+ trips, <a href='https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType' target='_blank'>ReacType</a> - a prototyping tool with 1.9k+ Github stars, and UCLA's <a href='https://humtech.ucla.edu/' target='_blank'>Humanities Technology</a> - a unit that supports 16 departments consisting of 200 staff and 40k students at the University of California in Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p>
              In my engineering work, I strive to balance my technical background across the stack with an aptitude for project management that is focused on delivering meaningful results.  At Disqus, I led an international cross-functional team in rewriting the Disqus B2B website, finishing a month ahead of schedule and leading to a <strong>20% increase</strong> in inbound leads.  And at UCLA, I managed a team of 7 through a yearlong migration of over 10TB of business data for the entire Humanities division from a sunsetting physical server to cloud storage that resulted in over <strong>$150k savings annually</strong> in operational costs.

              When I'm not at my computer, you can find me playing basketball, frequenting ethnic food joints in Los Angeles, traveling, or learning a new song on the keyboard.
